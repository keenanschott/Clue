- obviously add comments to clarify confusion about functionality/logic
- compartmentalize functionality into helper functions to improve clarity
	- i understand if you're only using a function once, and you see no need to
		- if that's the case just comment
- lots of redundant code
- liked how you guys handled both your layout and setup configs in one try branch

- confusing variable names (single letter)
	- try to be more specific (i.e. use row and col for looping variables, instead of i and j)
- variables should follow consistent naming standard (camelCase)
- add comment blocks above functions
- preface test blocks with comments to give context as to what's being tested
	- helps user reference the board layout file
- code is well organized and structured
