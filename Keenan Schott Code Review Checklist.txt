Keenan Schott Code Review Checklist

- header blocks present and thorough; comments should tell a story
- intuitive naming of variables and functions; can I understand its purpose just by looking at the name?
- check instance variable scope; is it protected or private?
- check the try-catch statements; is the Exception being squashed or being used in an intentful way on behalf of the user?
- check the tests - can I understand why the tests are written in a certain way through their organization/comments?
