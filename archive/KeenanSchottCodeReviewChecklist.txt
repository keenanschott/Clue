Keenan Schott Code Review Checklist

- header blocks present and thorough; comments should tell a story
- intuitive naming of variables and functions; can I understand its purpose just by looking at the name?
- check instance variable scope; is it protected or private?
- is graphics code clean and easy to follow?
- do classes follow the SRP for the most part?
