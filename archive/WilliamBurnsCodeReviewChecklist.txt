William Burns Code Review Checklist 

1. Avoid code duplication. If present, try to contain functionality within one specific method. 
2. If a function is too verbose, can it's functionality be condensed into multiple methods to provide a more organized, understandable flow.
3. Check for consistent variable naming conventions.
4. Avoid instantiating new objects inside loops. 
5. Does my code reflect the design choices I have made (specifically in graphics)?
