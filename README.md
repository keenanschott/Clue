# Clue
This was written for the software engineering class at Colorado School of Mines; a project that took several months to complete. It's by no means the cleanest code, but it was a fairly large project so I was and am proud of its magnitude. For a glimpse into the gameplay, `Clue.jar` is the playable file.
