William Burns Code Review Checklist 

1. Avoid code duplication. If present, try to contain functionality within one specific method. 
2. If a function is too verbose, can it's functionality be condensed into multiple methods to provide a more organized, understandable flow.
3. Check for consistent variable naming conventions.
4. Avoid instantiating new objects inside loops. 
5. Check for proper use of static (i.e call static methods using class name and not object name)
